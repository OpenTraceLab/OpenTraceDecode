Starting with lists.py changes first since pd.py depends on new data structures.","Updated command structure in lists.py: Added 256-entry cmds dict for annotations, base_cmds for standard commands, and cmds_micron for vendor-specific commands. This allows vendor command decoding while maintaining annotation compatibility.","Completed FlashChip class system and new chip definitions. Added FlashChip class with methods for key(), idstr(), has_ids(), matches(). Created chips_list with new FlashChip instances and maintained backward compatibility with chips_legacy dict. Added missing Infineon and Micron entries from PR #125.","Updated pd.py to work with new FlashChip class system: Added backward compatibility for both FlashChip class and legacy dict format, added n-byte addressing support initialization (addr_bytes), and updated emit_addr_bytes method to handle configurable address sizes. Still need to update all command handlers to use dynamic address size.","Added vendor command support: Updated initialization to get extra_cmds from chip definition, updated cmd_ann_list() to check vendor commands first before falling back to standard commands. This enables proper decoding of vendor-specific commands like Micron's RESET_ENABLE, ENTER4B, etc. All tests pass.","Successfully committed complete SPI flash enhancements from PR #125. Implemented all major features: FlashChip class system, n-byte addressing support, vendor command decoding, improved chip database, and maintained backward compatibility. All tests pass and changes are committed."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1761824807252"}
