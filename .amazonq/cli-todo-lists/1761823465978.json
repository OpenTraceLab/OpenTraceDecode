Replaced all deprecated fail_unless() calls with modern ck_assert() equivalents. Tests pass successfully. Changes committed.","Successfully implemented PR #121 UART packet data publishing. Added putp_packet() method and updated handle_packet() to output packet data to Python stream alongside existing annotations. Updated documentation to include new PACKET output type. Tests pass. Changes committed.","PR #125 SPI flash enhancements is very complex with 95 changes across 2 files, including major structural changes to chip database and command handling. Skipping for now to focus on simpler, higher-value PRs first.","Successfully implemented PR #120 OpenTherm protocol decoder. Created complete decoder with Manchester encoding support, 32-bit frame decoding, parity checking, message type identification, and comprehensive annotation output. Tests pass. Changes committed.","Successfully implemented PR #116 KeeLoq decoder (standalone PWM-based security protocol for remote keyless entry) and PR #117 AD5593R decoder (I2C-based ADC/DAC device decoder). Both decoders load properly and tests pass. Changes committed.","Completed PR #117 AD5593R decoder implementation as well."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1761823465978"}
